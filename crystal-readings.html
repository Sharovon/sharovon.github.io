    <p>Let a crystal reading guide you into answering your questions about life and relationship and aspirations. Your chosen selection of crystals reveals a story about you directly from your unconscious mind.</p>

    <p>The crystals are a tool to bring you a message about your personal power and what may be stopping you from achieving your goals and soul purpose.</p>
    
    <q>The creative is the place where no-one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you’ll discover will be wonderful. What you’ll discover is yourself</q>
